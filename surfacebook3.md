The touchscreen on your Microsoft Surface Book 3 not working after installing Linux Mint is a fairly common issue ‚Äî it typically comes down to **missing drivers or kernel support** for the Surface hardware.

Here's a breakdown of the situation and what you can do to fix it:

---

### üß† **Why the Touchscreen Isn't Working**

The Microsoft Surface Book 3 uses proprietary hardware (especially for touch and pen input) that isn't fully supported in most **default Linux kernels** ‚Äî including the one that ships with Linux Mint.

The touchscreen requires:

* A compatible Linux kernel version
* Additional firmware and drivers (especially for Surface input devices)
* Optional: Surface-specific tools/packages (like `libwacom-surface`, `surface-dtx-daemon`, etc.)

### ‚úÖ **How to Fix It**

#### **Option 1: Install Surface Linux Kernel (Recommended)**

A maintained kernel project called **"linux-surface"** adds support for most Surface devices.

#### üíª Steps:

1. **Update your system:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Add the Linux Surface kernel repository:**

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/main/pkg/add-repo.sh | sudo bash
   ```

3. **Install the Surface kernel and related packages:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install linux-image-surface linux-headers-surface iptsd libwacom-surface
   ```

4. **Set the new kernel as default (if needed):**
   Linux Mint should auto-detect the new kernel, but you can double-check with:

   ```bash
   sudo update-grub
   ```

5. **Reboot your Surface Book 3:**

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

6. **Check touchscreen:**
   Try tapping the screen after booting. You can confirm it's detected via:

   ```bash
   xinput
   ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Additional Tweaks (if touch still isn‚Äôt working):

* **Check if IPTS is enabled:**
  IPTS is Intel's Precise Touch & Stylus tech (used in Surface devices). The `iptsd` service needs to be running:

  ```bash
  systemctl status iptsd
  ```

* **Install `surface-control` (optional):**
  For managing power, keyboard detach, and other Surface-specific controls:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install surface-control
  ```
